This script is used to produce a masked bedfile (from gubbins output and snippy-core-self mask and phaster). 
It requires an input file (.tsv) which includes accession number of reference, start and stop position of nucleotides produced by Snippy and path to the directory where all gubbins output are. The script will produce gubbins_fullmask_complted.bed which can be used as an input later for complete analysis with Snippy.
